## Security
Highly secure as you don't have to enter your private key as input anywhere. Wallet connection is used to sign transactions.

NOTE: The app is secure and doesn't ask for Private Key as input. You can sign and send all the transactions at once using your Phantom Wallet. This is possible by using Phantom's signAllTransactions method. Further implementation details can be found in the docs.
